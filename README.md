# COVID19_Data_Analysis_April


Through this project,I learnt how to preprocess and merge datasets to calculate needed measures and prepare them for an Analysis.

I worked with the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. Also, I used another dataset consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe.

I merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.


I calculated aggregate of infected persons Because in each row of the dataframe I had data related to each province in each country, but for the analysis I needed number of confirmed cases related to each country.


STEPS INVOLVED:


Importing COVID19 dataset and preparing it for the analysis by dropping columns and aggregating rows.


Deciding on and calculating a good measure for our analysis.


Merging two datasets and finding correlations among our data.


Visualizing the analysis results using Seaborn.
